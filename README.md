## Game Design
One day a dark force appeared, and it was led by a powerful Dark Avatar who sought to take
over the kingdom. The Dark Avatar is a being who has mastered all four elements, just like
the Avatar, but has twisted his powers to serve his own selfish purposes. The Avatar knew
that he had to stop the Dark Avatar from taking over the kingdom, so he set out on a journey
to defeat him. The journey was divided into five levels, each one representing one of the
elements.
The first level is the Earth level, where the Avatar has to defeat Earth monsters and avoid
rock obstacles around the screen in rocky terrain.
The second level is the Water level, where the Avatar has to defeat water monsters and avoid
waves around the screen in ocean terrain.

The third level is the Fire level, where the Avatar has to defeat fire monsters and avoid
flames around the screen in a volcanic terrain

The fourth level is the Air level, where the Avatar has to defeat fellow air nomads' friends
because they turned dark and made them back to normal and avoided winds of gusts around the
screen in the air.

Finally, the Avatar reached the Final Boss, the Spirit level, where he had to face the Dark
Avatar in a one-on-one battle to determine the fate of the kingdom.
Within each level, the avatar can collect hearts to increase HP and coins to use at the end of
each level to upgrade MAX HP or upgrade attack points. You can also change skins and
unlock new skins for your avatar at the end of each round.
